        </div>
        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>Attracting the right audience to your website is important, but it is also only the first step toward having a successful website. Once you have website traffic, you can focus on converting that traffic by encouraging them to explore your website and ultimately turn into a customer. Finding the formula that turns your website, visitors, into customers is key to the success of your business.</p>
            <p>At Buys Management, converting website traffic into customers is our #1 priority after the successful launch of your website, and it should be your top priority as well.</p>
            <p>“Your website should be your best salesperson. Everything, from design, development, and maintenance should be focused on conversions” – Tarin Buys, Buys Management Founder</p>
            <p>Use the tips below to start turning your website visitors into customers that keep coming back for more.</p>
            <h2>5 ways to convert your e-commerce store visitors into customers to increase conversions and loyalty</h2>
            <p>Is your website not producing the results you wanted, such as sales and leads? That’s okay, unfortunately most businesses experience the same thing – but you can make some changes and turn your website into a real asset for your business, as it should be. Below are 5 tips or tactics to help your website conversions:</p>
            <h3>1. Have a clear CTA (call to action)</h3>
            <p>This one might seem obvious, but most businesses confuse their website visitors by having too many call-to-actions visible, with no clear differentiation. Do you want your customers to purchase a particular product? Want them to call you? Want them to book an appointment? Whatever your goal is, make it clear to your viewers. If you have more than one CTA, choose the one that is the most important, the one that brings you closer to your business goals, and make it stand out more than any other CTA on your website. See a simple example below:</p>
            
            <h3>2. Simplify your navigation</h3>
            <p>Website navigation should be intuitive – users should find it easy to use and understand, even if it’s their first time visiting your website. When deciding what to add to your navigation, think about what you want your website visitors to do on your website, and consider what your website visitors might want to do on your website that you haven’t thought of. Pages with commercial intent (generates sales) should be in your websites top navigation, while pages with no commercial intent (does not generate sales) should be in your bottom navigation.</p>
            <p>For example, let’s say you have a navigation bar with the following pages: Home, Shop, Careers, and Contact Us. The goal of your website is to encourage website visitors to purchase products. You are receiving website visitors, but sales are very slow so you decide to check your website analytics to do some investigating. You notice that once users land on your “Home” page, they typically click on the “Careers” page and then bounce – meaning they leave the website – before buying or viewing any products.</p>
            <p>As your website designer, I would suggest that you move the “Careers” page from your top navigation to your footer (bottom navigation, lowest section of each page on your website). Even though the “Careers” page is getting views and clicks, that traffic is not the focus of your website – your focus is to get sales. See where I’m going with this? Keep your navigation simple, and user-centered, but keep your business goals in mind and prioritize.</p>
            <h3>3. Functionality and great design</h3>
            <p>Converting your website visitors into customers is a lot harder when your customers find it difficult to use your website or find the design off-putting. Create a website experience that your visitors enjoy and find visually pleasing and engaging. Two things you can do to encourage conversions are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use original visuals.</li>
                <li>Wherever possible, use high-quality, original images and videos on your website.</li>
                <li>Make your users feel inspired by your visuals.</li>
                <li>The images should clearly show your product from several angles and allow the user to click and magnify it to see greater detail.</li>
                <li>Videos should be short and to the point and show examples of how your product is used.</li>
                <li>Efficient performance.</li>
                <li>Your website menus should be user-friendly and include drop-down submenus for different areas.</li>
                <li>The links on your website should load quickly and be obvious to the user so they know where they can click and your site’s internal search button should be easy to find. Having your website set up right and efficiently immediately shows visitors that your business is professional.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4. Build Relationships</h3>
            <p>For new visitors to turn into loyal customers, they need to feel connected to your brand in some way. A lot of your marketing, and the copy on your website, is going to be focused on building this connection with your potential customers.</p>
            <p>Quick Tip: If you have a following on social media but your followers are not purchasing your products or services, you might want to spend extra time on this step and really nurture your audience before trying to sell to them. What works really well in these situations is to encourage your audience to give you their contact details so that you can start a conversation with them. Offer them something like a free guide, an e-book, or whatever your audience would be interested in, in exchange for their contact details. Once you have their details, you can start nurtuing that audience until they are ready to buy your product or book your service. This is very time consuming, but very rewarding.</p>
            <p>The key to building relationships with your visitors is to constantly provide value to them. On your website, create a pop up that activates once the user that been exploring your website for a few seconds. For this pop up, your goal is to collect their information, and in return you can offer them something. If you would like to offer a discount, make sure it is worthwhile (please don’t be surprised if no one signs up to your email list if you’re offering a 5-10% discount). The more exciting your offer is, the more website visitors will sign up to your email list where you can nurture them until they become a customer.</p>
            <h3>5. Live Chat</h3>
            <p>Communication is important in all relationships, and when it comes to online shopping, it is no different. Customers are more likely to engage with your website – and convert – if they know how to contact you. The faster you respond to a potential customer, the more brownie points you get.</p>
            <p>Ensure that your contact information is featured across your website and is easy to access. That being said, Live Chat is a game-changer for conversions. When you’re physical store, you can walk up to a worker and ask if they have something in stock, or in a different colour, and they can go check for you. You probably asked them to go check even though you have other options in the store to choose from. Now think about how you feel when the shop assistant comes back with exactly what you wanted. You feel great right? You will probably go striaght to the checkout line and pay. That feeling is what Live Chat allows customers to experience.</p>
            <p>Although being available to your customers is important, you have to consider how much time you or your team can allocate to customer service. Be honest and transparent with your website visitors, set expectations and stick to it. Is your websites live chat feature only available during office-hours? Great, let them know. Does it take you 2-3 business days to respond to an email? That’s okay, just let them know. You’ll be surprised how valuable customers find transparency.</p>
            <p>Use these 5 tips to start increasing your website conversions. Always put yourself in your target customers’ shoes when using your website and look for ways your can improve it.
